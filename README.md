around Lanciano from HERE Maps using Python
programing language. the base code is from Vivek
(2020) and  Iovanovici et al. (2020) which was
modified accordingly as expressed in methodology.

tha data is extracted every one hour during
29.01.2021 Friday and 30.01.21 Saturday to
examine traffic trends in a weekday and on weekend.

methodology:

1 - personal HERE API key is inserted
2 - local time is set to Rome
